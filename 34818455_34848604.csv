34818757,Energy-socio-economic-environmental modelling for the EU energy and post-COVID-19 transitions.
34818757,"Relevant energy questions have arisen because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic shock leads to emissions' reductions consistent with the rates of decrease required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. Those unforeseen drastic reductions in emissions are temporary as long as they do not involve structural changes. However, the COVID-19 consequences and the subsequent policy response will affect the economy for decades. Focusing on the EU, this discussion article argues how recovery plans are an opportunity to deepen the way towards a low-carbon economy, improving at the same time employment, health, and equity and the role of modelling tools. Long-term alignment with the low-carbon path and the development of a resilient transition towards renewable sources should guide instruments and policies, conditioning aid to energy-intensive sectors such as transport, tourism, and the automotive industry. However, the potential dangers of short-termism and carbon leakage persist. The current energy-socio-economic-environmental modelling tools are precious to widen the scope and deal with these complex problems. The scientific community has to assess disparate, non-equilibrium, and non-ordinary scenarios, such as sectors and countries lockdowns, drastic changes in consumption patterns, significant investments in renewable energies, and disruptive technologies and incorporate uncertainty analysis. All these instruments will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of decarbonization options and potential consequences on employment, income distribution, and vulnerability."
34818767,Mucormycosis (black fungus) ensuing COVID-19 and comorbidity meets - Magnifying global pandemic grieve and catastrophe begins.
34818767,"Post COVID-19, mucormycosis occurred after the SARS-CoV-2 has rampaged the human population and is a scorching problem among the pandemic globally, particularly among Asian countries. Invasive mucormycosis has been extensively reported from mild to severe COVID-19 survivors. The robust predisposing factor seems to be uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, comorbidity and immunosuppression acquired through steroid therapy. The prime susceptive reason for the increase of mucormycosis cases is elevated iron levels in the serum of the COVID survivors. A panoramic understanding of the infection has been elucidated based on clinical manifestation, genetic and non- genetic mechanisms of steroid drug administration, biochemical pathways and immune modulated receptor associations. This review lime-lights and addresses the ""What"", ""Why"", ""How"" and ""When"" about the COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM) in a comprehensive manner with a pure intention to bring about awareness to the common public as the cases are inevitably and exponentially increasing in India and global countries as well. The article also unearthed the pathogenesis of mucormycosis and its association with the COVID-19 sequela, the plausible routes of entry, diagnosis and counter remedies to keep the infection at bay. Cohorts of case reports were analysed to spotlight the link between the pandemic COVID-19 and the nightmare-mucormycosis."
34818770,Antiviral drug Umifenovir (Arbidol) in municipal wastewater during the COVID-19 pandemic: Estimated levels and transformation.
34818770,"An indole derivative umifenovir (Arbidol) is one of the most widely used antiviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and some other viral infections. The purpose of the present study was to shed light on the transformation processes of umifenovir in municipal wastewater, including disinfection with active chlorine, as well as to assess the levels of the antiviral drug and its metabolites entering and accumulating in natural reservoirs under conditions of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The combination of high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization high-resolution mass-spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for tentative identification and quantification of umifenovir and its transformation products in model reaction mixtures and real samples of wastewater, river water, biological sludge and bottom sediments taken at the wastewater treatment plant in Arkhangelsk, a large cultural and industrial center at the Russian North. Laboratory experiments allowed identifying fifteen bromine-containing transformation products, forming at the initial stages of the chlorination and fourteen classic volatile and semi volatile disinfection by-products with bromoform as the dominant one. Chlorinated derivatives are only the minor disinfection by-products forming by substitution of alkylamine group in the aromatic ring. The schemes of umifenovir transformation in reactions with dissolved oxygen and sodium hypochlorite are proposed. Two established primary transformation products formed by oxidation of the thioether group to sulfoxide and elimination of thiophenol were detected in noticeable concentrations in the wastewater together with their precursor. The level of umifenovir reached 1.3 mg kg-1 in the sludge and municipal wastewater treat contained 1 μg L-1 of that drug, while its removal during biological wastewater treatment was about 40%. Pronounced accumulation of umifenovir and its transformation products in biological sludge and bottom sediments of natural reservoirs may be a source of the future secondary pollution of the environment."
34818780,Minimizing errors in RT-PCR detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for wastewater surveillance.
34818780,"Wastewater surveillance for pathogens using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is an effective and resource-efficient tool for gathering community-level public health information, including the incidence of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater can potentially provide an early warning signal of COVID-19 infections in a community. The capacity of the world's environmental microbiology and virology laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 RNA characterization in wastewater is increasing rapidly. However, there are no standardized protocols or harmonized quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance. This paper is a technical review of factors that can cause false-positive and false-negative errors in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, culminating in recommended strategies that can be implemented to identify and mitigate some of these errors. Recommendations include stringent QA/QC measures, representative sampling approaches, effective virus concentration and efficient RNA extraction, PCR inhibition assessment, inclusion of sample processing controls, and considerations for RT-PCR assay selection and data interpretation. Clear data interpretation guidelines (e.g., determination of positive and negative samples) are critical, particularly when the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is low. Corrective and confirmatory actions must be in place for inconclusive results or results diverging from current trends (e.g., initial onset or reemergence of COVID-19 in a community). It is also prudent to perform interlaboratory comparisons to ensure results' reliability and interpretability for prospective and retrospective analyses. The strategies that are recommended in this review aim to improve SARS-CoV-2 characterization and detection for wastewater surveillance applications. A silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that the efficacy of wastewater surveillance continues to be demonstrated during this global crisis. In the future, wastewater should also play an important role in the surveillance of a range of other communicable diseases."
34818797,Spatial and temporal variability and data bias in wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a sewer system.
34818797,"The response to disease outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be constrained by a limited ability to measure disease prevalence early at a localized level. Wastewater based epidemiology is a powerful tool identifying disease spread from pooled community sewer networks or at influent to wastewater treatment plants. However, this approach is often not applied at a granular level that permits detection of local hot spots. This study examines the spatial patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage through a spatial sampling strategy across neighborhood-scale sewershed catchments. Sampling was conducted across the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area from November to mid-December of 2020. This research utilized local spatial autocorrelation tests to identify the evolution of statistically significant neighborhood hot spots in sewershed sub-catchments that were identified to lead waves of infection, with adjacent neighborhoods observed to lag with increasing viral RNA concentrations over subsequent dates. The correlations between the sub-catchments over the sampling period were also characterized using principal component analysis. Results identified distinct time series patterns, with sewersheds in the urban center, outlying suburban areas, and outlying urbanized districts generally following unique trends over the sampling period. Several demographic parameters were identified as having important gradients across these areas, namely population density, poverty levels, household income, and age. These results provide a more strategic approach to identify disease outbreaks at the neighborhood level and characterized how sampling site selection could be designed based on the spatial and demographic characteristics of neighborhoods."
34818836,[Analysis on influencing factors of HIV testing services utilization in students with self-assessed high risk of HIV infection based on Andersen's model].
34818836,"Objective: To analyze the influencing factors for HIV testing services utilization in students with self-assessed high risk of HIV infection. Methods: The research framework of the influencing factors for HIV testing services utilization in students was developed based on Andersen's health services utilization behavioral model and related literature. A cross-sectional survey was performed in students with self-assessed high risk of HIV infection by an online HIV infection risk assessment tool from March to April 2019. Multiple logistic regressions were applied with hierarchical model. Results: A total of 526 students were included in the study (age: 19.30±1.19 years old), in whom 96.2% agreed that HIV testing should be received after high-risk behavior. 56.7% (298/526) had sexual behavior and the HIV testing rate was 11.0% (58/526). The HIV testing rates in students who had and had no sex behavior were 13.42%(40/298) and 7.89% (18/228), respectively. According to the results from multivariate logistic regression analysis, non-heterosexual (compared with heterosexual, OR=7.88, 95%CI: 3.98-15.61) and higher score of AIDS knowledge awareness (compared with lower score, OR=2.05, 95%CI: 1.07-3.93) in propensity factor module, and having risk sexual behavior (compared with having no risk sexual behavior, OR=2.66, 95%CI: 1.41-5.03) and having diagnosis of STD infection in hospital (compared with having no such diagnosis, OR=6.35, 95%CI: 2.21-18.27) in demand factor module, and receiving health education about AIDS prevention in the past year (compared with receiving no such health education, OR=0.29, 95%CI: 0.11-0.76) and receiving health education about AIDS testing service in the past year (compared with receiving no such health education, OR=3.67, 95%CI: 1.71-7.90) in ability factor module were the influencing factors for utilization of HIV testing services. Conclusions: The acceptance of HIV testing in students needs to be improved urgently. Propensity factors, such as their AIDS knowledge awareness and sexual orientation, and demand factors, such as having risk sexual behavior and STD infection, have obvious impacts on the utilization of HIV testing services. However, health education about AIDS prevention and HIV testing service can play a more important role in facilitating the utilization of HIV testing in students. In the future, we should further strengthen the publicity of voluntary HIV counseling and testing service in students with particular attention to girls and those with risk sexual behaviors."

34818922,"The current situation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide is still very severe. Presently, many breakthroughs have been accomplished in the research and development of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, especially vaccines; however, some of the so-called COVID-19-specific drugs highlighted in the early stage failed to achieve the expected curative effect. There is no antiviral therapy available, by stimulating protective immunity vaccine is the best choice for the future management of infection. Therefore, we aimed to identify the latest developments in the research and development of these drugs and vaccines and provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."

34818923,"Oral booster-single strain probiotic bifidobacteria could be a potential strategy for SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to evaluate the role of oral probiotic Bifidobacterium on moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 inpatients. In this single-center study, we analyzed data of 44 moderate/severe inpatients with diagnosed COVID-19 in Istanbul Maltepe University Medical Faculty Hospital, 2020 from 1 November 2020 to 15 December 2020. Clinical and medication features were compared and analyzed between patients with or without probiotic. In result, 19 of the 44 patients (43.18%) who were administrated with oral booster-single strain probiotic were discharged with the median inpatient day of 7.6 days which were significantly shorter than those of patients without probiotic. There were significant differences in inpatient days, radiological improvement at day 6 and week 3, and reduction in interleukin-6 levels in those receiving oral probiotic therapy. Although the mortality rate was 5% in the probiotic group, it was 25% in the non-probiotic group. Booster-single strain probiotic bifidobacteria could be an effective treatment strategy for moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 inpatients to reduce the mortality and length of stay in hospital."

34819216,"BACKGROUND: While many COVID-19 studies focus on acute effects of the infection, few examine the intermediate and long-term sequelae of the illness. Studies have shown that a good portion of patients have chronic effects in several body systems for several months or longer. Such effects can potentially adversely impact pilot performance in flight. We sought to determine the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection, how such effects can affect pilot performance, and how to best evaluate pilots for aeromedical flight clearance.METHODS: We used the PubMed literature search engine to review peer-reviewed articles that focused on the intermediate and long-term effects of COVID-19 infection. Chronic signs and symptoms were subdivided based on the particular body organ system affected. Merging information obtained from case reviews, article reviews, and aeromedical standards, we created a risk stratification guide to assist with the aeromedical disposition of affected pilots.RESULTS: Long-term effects of COVID-19 infection can last for several months or longer. The most common effects are fatigue, weakness, pulmonary diffusion defects, depression, and anxiety.DISCUSSION: This review article focuses on the most common intermediate- and long-term COVID-19 conditions of aeromedical significance and the corresponding course of actions recommended for the aeromedical examiner. Aeromedical evaluation should take into consideration factors related to the pilot, aircraft type, and specific aviation environment. Such evaluation may include diagnostic testing, medical specialist consultation, preflight simulation in an altitude chamber, human centrifuge testing, and/or a flight simulator checkride.Ko SY, Nguyen NK, Lee CL, Lee LA, Nguyen KUT, Lee EC. ."

34819431,Prevalence of Loss of Smell and/or Taste and other Otorhinolaryngology Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients.
34819431,"Background Loss of smell and/or taste have been described in COVID-19 patients. Studies have not been conducted to evaluate the loss of smell and/or taste in the context of Nepal. Objective To investigate the prevalence of Ear, Nose and Throat related symptoms and assess smell and taste disorders in laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. Method This prospective cross-sectional study evaluated patients from September 2020 to March 2021 with preceding COVID-19 diagnosis from a tertiary centre in Kathmandu. COVID-19 positive patients visiting out-patient department, quarantined or admitted were included. Patients were given questionnaire consisting of demographic data, history of smoking and evaluation of presenting symptoms. Loss of smell and taste were subjectively tested and followed up via telephone for ten weeks to evaluate for recovery time and degree of recovery. Result A total of 226 patients participated in the study, 18-92 years old (mean age, 36.77 ± 15.23 years; 53.5% males, 69% non-smokers). Majority of the patients had Myalgia (n = 128, 56.6%) as their presenting symptoms followed by fever (n = 122, 53.9%), loss of smell (n = 117, 51.7%), cough (n = 107, 47.34) and sore throat (n = 102, 45.1%). Loss of sense of smell and taste was reported in 51.8% and 42% respectively. The association between loss of sense of smell and taste was statistically significant (p < .001). All patients had some degree of recovery with 64.1% recovery of smell and 64.2% recovery of taste within 14 days of onset of symptoms. The mean recovery time for sense of smell and taste was 14.34 ± 9.82 days and 15.03 ± 10.06 days, respectively. Conclusion Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are cardinal features of COVID-19. They recover spontaneously along with other symptoms within few weeks. The absence of smell or taste in times of pandemic can be suggestive of potential COVID-19 infection and be used as a screening tool for early diagnosis and reduce transmission of the infection."
34819443,Whole Genome Sequence Analysis to Identify SARS-CoV-2 Variant in Nepal.
34819443,"Background The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has become a global public health crisis. Nepal is facing the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic but, there is still a limited data on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Nepal. Objective The objective of this study is to sequence the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 in Nepal to detect possible mutation profiles and phylogenetic lineages of circulating SARSCoV-2 variants. Method In this study, swab samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. After RNA extraction, the investigation was performed through real-time PCR followed by whole genome sequencing. The consensus genome sequences were, then, analyzed with appropriate bioinformatics tools. Result Sequence analysis of two SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patient without travel history (Patient A1 and A2) were found to be of lineage B.1.1. Similarly, among other four samples from subjects returning from the United Kingdom, genomes of two samples were of lineage B.1.36, and the other two were of lineage B.1.1.7 (Alpha Variant). The mutations in the consensus genomes contained the defining mutations of the respective lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion We confirmed two genomic sequences of variant of concern VOC-202012/01 in Nepal. Our study provides the concise genomic evidence for spread of different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 - B.1.1, B.1.36 and B.1.1.7 of SARS-CoV-2 in Nepal."

34819448,"These risk factors of advancing age, male gender and co-existing health conditions like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity do not fully explain why some people have no or mild symptoms whereas others have severe symptoms. Genomewide association study (GWAS) identify a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with COVID-19 with respiratory failure. They also found a higher risk among persons with blood group A and protective effect for blood group O than among patients with other blood groups. The particular haplotype in a region of chromosome 3 is contributed to modern humans by neandertals. Another Neanderthal haplotype on chromosome 12 is associated with a 22% reduction in relative risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19. The ApoE e4e4 homozygous genotype was found to increase the risk of severe COVID-19. Change in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 gene was also found to be associated with increased risk of COVID-19, cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions."

The outbreak of the COVID-19 has highlighted the problems confronting the global governance of international public health, such as limited functions of international organizations and difficulties in achieving objectives, poor collaboration between governance subjects and their limited performance, overlapping legal basis of governance and blurred core function, and lack of solutions to special problems. The corresponding approaches can be taken to improve the efficiency of the governance of global public health, including supporting the role of international organizations to achieve the objectives, enhancing coordination among international governance subjects to form synergy, promoting the compliance with IHR2005 to avoid conflict of law application and upholding the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind to jointly respond to the special problems."
34820347,Self-Reported Obsession Toward COVID-19 Preventive Measures Among Undergraduate Medical Students During the Early Phase of Pandemic in Jordan.
34820347,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its associated precautionary measures have substantial impacts not only on the medical, economic, and social context but also on psychological health. This study aimed to assess the obsession toward COVID-19 preventive measures among undergraduate medical students during the early phase of the pandemic in Jordan. Methods: Online questionnaires were distributed between March 16, 2020 and March 19, 2020. Socio-demographic characteristics were collected, and self-reported obsession toward COVID-19 preventive measures was assessed using a single question.COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary measures were evaluated using scales. Using the chi-square test, Student t-test, and one-way ANOVA, we assessed the differences in the obsession of students with socio-demographic characteristics and scores of the scales. Results: A total of 1,404 participants (60% were female participants) completed the survey with a participation rate of 15.6%. Obsession with preventive measures was reported by 6.8%. Obsession was significantly more common among women (9.2%) than men (3.3%) and students who attended COVID-19 lectures (9.5%) than those who did not attend such lectures (5.8%) (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Obsessed participants reported significantly higher levels of COVID-19 knowledge (p = 0.012) and precautionary measures (p < 0.001). COVID-19 risk perception had a mild effect size difference but with no statistical significance (p = 0.075). There were no significant differences in the academic levels of participants (p = 0.791) and universities (p = 0.807) between students who were obsessed and those who were not. Conclusions: Obsession is one of the significant but unspoken psychological effects of COVID-19 precautionary measures among undergraduate medical students. Medical schools should be equipped with means to handle pandemic psychological effects."
34820350,Attitudes and Commitment Toward Precautionary Measures Against COVID-19 Amongst the Jordanian Population: A Large-Scale Cross-Sectional Survey.
34820350,"Aims: This study aimed to (1) assess the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that were used by the Jordanian population against COVID-19, and (2) determine the sociodemographic and behavioral predictors of contracting COVID-19 with a focus on the utilization of personal precautionary measures. Methods: A descriptive questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was used in this study. A structured web-based questionnaire was disseminated to the Jordanian community through social media platforms. Participants were asked a series of questions about socio-demographic characteristics, in addition to the knowledge, attitudes, and commitment toward using various personal precautionary measures (e.g., face mask, hand washing, social distancing) against the COVID-19. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, and binary logistic regression through SPSS®. Results: Responses from 7,746 participants were included in our final analyses. Descriptive statistics showed that most participants (82.6%) believed that face mask protects against COVID-19. Around 69.5% of the participants were completely committed to wearing a face mask, while 65% of the participants were completely committed to hand washing. The results of the regression analysis revealed that female gender (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.07-1.35; p = 0.002), having a family member infected with COVID-19 (AOR = 8.5; 95% Cl: 7.51-9.70; p = 0.001), having a health-related work or study (AOR = 1.2; 95% Cl: 1.09-1.38; p = 0.001), believing that face masks do not protect against COVID-19 (AOR = 1.3; 95% Cl: 1.12-1.47; p = 0.001), and partial commitment to handwashing (AOR = 1.2; 95% Cl: 1.11-1.75; p = 0.006) were all associated with an increased odds of contracting COVID-19 among the participants. Conclusion: Overall, commitment to non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures, such as wearing a face mask, hand washing, and physical distancing, was not optimal among Jordanians. This might explain the dramatic increase in the infectivity rate of the COVID-19 virus in the past few months in the country. More sustainable efforts regarding health promotion and strict policies are required to prevent a third wave of hitting the country and to prevent similar infectious threats in the future."

34820354,Investigation of Health Science Students' Knowledge Regarding Healthy Lifestyle Promotion During the Spread of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
34820354,"Background: Health sciences students as future health care providers, can play a valuable role in protecting societies against the spread of COVID-19 through health promotion and lifestyle modification education. Therefore, proper education of these students is essential. Objective: This study sought to assess and measure the change of knowledge of health sciences students regarding healthy lifestyle promotion strategies during the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, after participation in different types of online and social media educational programs. Methods: In order to serve the purpose of the study, a methodological research design was first used to ensure the validation of the developed scale; the COVID-19 Healthy Lifestyle Promotion Scale (COVID-19 HLPS). The study utilized a four-arm randomized control research design in which the participants were randomly assigned into one of four groups, (1) control group (placebo intervention), (2) brochure group, who received brochures relevant to healthy lifestyle promotion, (3) Instagram group, who received similar information but through Instagram posts, and (4) online interactive educational workshop group, who also received similar information through an online interactive educational workshop. Results: In total, 155 participants participated in the online and social media intervention programs. There was a significant improvement in the intervention groups in the total knowledge subscale of the healthy promotion strategies compared with the control group (p < 0.001). Overall, the workshop group was the most effective group (effect size = 1.54) followed by the Instagram group (effect size = 0.99) and then the brochure group (effect size = 0.91). Conclusions: In order to meet the challenges posed by this pandemic, the use of such online and social media interventions is essential and may be the key for health promotion during this pandemic. Health science students, as future health care professionals, can play a fundamental role during the COVID-19 pandemic in disseminating knowledge relevant to healthy lifestyle to their families and communities thus promoting healthy living and behavioral changes. We propose the development of research initiatives at both national and international levels targeting changes within health science curricula that can meet potential challenges of future pandemics, leading to advancement of health care services globally."

34821342,The issue of infertility in times of COVID-19: what do we know about it?
34821342,"Couple infertility constitutes a major source of concern and even distress for those involved, affecting roughly 50-80 million people in the world, according to World Health Organization data. There is no denying that medical and technological advancements in the field of as-sisted reproductive technology (ART) are among the greatest and most beneficial achievements of modern medicine. Countless couples have been able to achieve parenthood who in the past could not have, thanks to ART. Infertility itself used to be deemed insurmountable, especially when arising from uterine conditions (referred to as absolute uterine factor infertility, AUFI), neoplastic conditions or major complications affecting reproductive organs during previous pregnancies. The inability to have children is often considered by couples as a failure severely impacting their relationships, due to the unfulfilled biological potential in regard to parenting. However, in addition to its significance as a social problem, infertility is a medical issue which requires a strict and clearly defined path of diagnosis and treatment, particularly in times of COVID-19, when access to essential care has often been delayed with potentially harmful repercussions for patients seeking to achieve parenthood or to keep their fertility."

34821484,Impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on frailty and wellbeing in older people and those living with long-term conditions.
34821484,"Lockdowns and social distancing have been important and successful strategies to limit the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus. However, excess deaths related to non-COVID-19 causes have been reported, suggesting issues around availability and use of health services, particularly for people with conditions needing ongoing medical support. In addition, evidence indicates that a range of age-related diseases and frailty are impacted by physical activity and social engagement, both limited in lockdown situations. It is therefore important to learn from the effects of lockdowns in order to limit any impacts, while still protecting people from the infection. This editorial summarizes two research themes at the Centre for Ageing Research at Lancaster University in the UK, one assessing impacts of lockdown for people living with a long-term neurodegenerative condition, Parkinson's disease, and one assessing longitudinal impacts on frailty and wellbeing, with older adults aged over 70, including those living with at least one long-term condition. Uncertainty related to Parkinson's disease and to COVID-19 amplified each other, and cancelled clinical appointments and limitations on physical activity had very significant impacts on wellbeing for this group. In the longitudinal study, frailty was more severe during lockdown periods. While lockdowns reduce spread of the virus, becoming frailer could make older adults more vulnerable to the effects of the virus during these periods. Regular exercise during lockdown had beneficial effects aiding recovery once restrictions relaxed. These studies suggest factors that could lessen negative impacts of future lockdowns. Maintaining physical activity and providing access to health services during periods of lockdown are suggested as priorities."

34821650,Emerging Biosensors to Detect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): A Review.
34821650,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global health crisis caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard test for diagnosing COVID-19. Although it is highly accurate, this lab test requires highly-trained personnel and the turn-around time is long. Rapid and inexpensive immuno-diagnostic tests (antigen or antibody test) are available, but these point of care (POC) tests are not as accurate as the RT-PCR test. Biosensors are promising alternatives to these rapid POC tests. Here we review three types of recently developed biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 detection: surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based, electrochemical and field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors. We explain the sensing principles and discuss the advantages and limitations of these sensors. The accuracies of these sensors need to be improved before they could be translated into POC devices for commercial use. We suggest potential biorecognition elements with highly selective target-analyte binding that could be explored to increase the true negative detection rate. To increase the true positive detection rate, we suggest two-dimensional materials and nanomaterials that could be used to modify the sensor surface to increase the sensitivity of the sensor."

34822708,A Case of COVID-19-Associated Free-Floating Aortic Thrombus Successfully Treated with Thrombectomy.
34822708,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with a hypercoagulable state in which patients can be at risk for developing venous and arterial thromboembolic events at a rate as high as 31%. A free-floating aortic thrombus (FFT) is a rare life-threatening complication of a hypercoagulable state. These thrombi require medical, endovascular, or surgical treatment. The optimal treatment modality for FFT occurring in the setting of COVID-19 remains unknown. We present a patient with a COVID-19-associated free-floating descending aortic thrombus that was treated with percutaneous vacuum-assisted thrombectomy (angio-VAC). CASE REPORT A 61-year-old man presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypoxia and was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Initial chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) did not show pulmonary emboli or thrombi. Inflammatory markers (D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, fibrinogen) were tracked every other day. After several measurements of decreasing D-dimer values, there was a noticeable increase in D-dimer level and continued dependence on high levels of supplemental oxygen. A repeat chest CTA showed an FFT, confirmed by transesophageal echocardiogram. Cardiothoracic surgery and interventional radiology teams performed successful angio-VAC percutaneous removal, confirmed with intravascular ultrasound. The patient was subsequently discharged with a 3-month supply of apixaban. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive endovascular removal of an FFT is a therapeutic option, as anticoagulation alone carries the risk of partial lysis and repeat embolization. Clinicians can consider this endovascular treatment option paired with therapeutic anticoagulation. Further guidelines on monitoring and treatment of possible COVID-19-associated thrombosis are needed, particularly when the risk of embolization is high."

34823403,"The present study aimed to identify the factors associated with the distribution of the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. In this study, we used 9 variables: human development index (HDI), gross domestic product (GDP per capita), Gini index, population density, extreme poverty, life expectancy, COVID cases, COVID deaths, and reproduction rate. The time period was until February 1, 2021. The variable of interest was the sum of the days after the vaccine arrived in the countries. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated, and t-test was performed between the groups that received and did not receive the immunizer, and finally, a stepwise linear regression model was used. 58 (30.4%) of the 191 countries received the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The countries that received the most doses were the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Israel. Vaccine access in days showed a positive Pearson correlation HDI, GDP, life expectancy, COVID-19 cases, deaths, and reproduction rate. Human development level, COVID-19 deaths, GDP per capita, and population density are able to explain almost 50% of the speed of access to immunizers. Countries with higher HDI and per capita income obtained priority access."

34823627,Alveolar macrophages: novel therapeutic targets for respiratory diseases.
34823627,"Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are lung-resident myeloid cells that sit at the interface of the airway and lung tissue. Under homeostatic conditions, their primary function is to clear debris, dead cells and excess surfactant from the airways. They also serve as innate pulmonary sentinels for respiratory pathogens and environmental airborne particles and as regulators of pulmonary inflammation. However, they have not typically been viewed as primary therapeutic targets for respiratory diseases. Here, we discuss the role of AMs in various lung diseases, explore the potential therapeutic strategies to target these innate cells and weigh the potential risks and challenges of such therapies. Additionally, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the role AMs play in severe disease and the therapeutic strategies that have been harnessed to modulate their function and protect against severe lung damage. There are many novel approaches in development to target AMs, such as inhaled antibiotics, liposomal and microparticle delivery systems, and host-directed therapies, which have the potential to provide critical treatment to patients suffering from severe respiratory diseases, yet there is still much work to be done to fully understand the possible benefits and risks of such approaches."

34824683,Cardiovascular Disease Prevention During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned and Future Opportunities.
34824683,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been the defining healthcare issue since its outbreak, consuming healthcare systems and disrupting all aspects of human life throughout 2020 and continuing through 2021. When reviewing cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the first tendency may be to focus on the negative disruption. Months of quarantine, isolation, and missed healthcare visits or delayed care may have exacerbated the epidemic of CVD in the United States. Looking back, however, perhaps it wasn't a lost year as much as a health crisis that better prepared us for the battle to improve cardiovascular health. The pandemic brought new platforms for interacting with patients eager to engage, presenting a unique opportunity to reset how we approach preventive care. In this review, we discuss what the pandemic has taught us about caring for those vulnerable patients who were most afflicted-older adults, persons of color, and people facing adverse socioeconomic circumstances-and who continue to be impacted by CVD. We also identify opportunities for enhanced CVD prevention now boosted by the overnight adoption of telemedicine and other innovative cardiac care models. Lastly, we discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has motivated physicians and patients alike to prioritize our health above all else, if only transiently, and how we can leverage this increased health awareness and investment into long-term, meaningful disease prevention."
34824739,Molecular Docking and ADMET Prediction of Natural Compounds towards SARS Spike Glycoprotein-Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.
34824739,"More than a decade ago, a novel coronavirus that infects humans, bats, and certain other mammals termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused an epidemic with ~ 10% case fatality, creating global panic and economic damage. Recently, another strain of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused an infectious disease (COVID-19) in humans which was detected for the first time in Wuhan, China. Presently, there is no specific therapy available for the treatment of COVID-19. However, social distancing, patient isolation, and supportive medical care make up the current management for this current infectious disease pandemic. The present in silico study evaluated the binding affinities of some natural products (resveratrol, xylopic acid, ellagic acid, kaempferol, and quercetin) to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) main protease compared to chloroquine, an inhibitor known to prevent cellular entry and replication of the coronavirus. The respective binding energies of the selected natural compounds and chloroquine towards the proteins were computed using PyRx virtual screening tool. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic attributes of the selected compounds were predicted using admetSAR. Molecular docking analysis showed that the natural compounds had better scores towards the selected protein compared to chloroquine with polar amino acid residues present at the binding sites. The predicted ADMET properties revealed the lower acute oral toxicity of the natural products compared to chloroquine. The study provides evidence suggesting that the relatively less toxic compounds from the natural sources could be repositioned as anti-viral agents to prevent the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2."

34833358,"Background and Objectives: ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19) is a critical public health problem that has affected all fields, including dentistry. The dental management of children has become even more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current knowledge, attitudes and practices of Turkish pediatric dentists who have been providing dental treatments to children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: After receiving ethical approval, this cross-sectional study was conducted using the Google Forms online survey instrument. An online questionnaire link was sent to all the members of the Turkish Society of Paediatric Dentistry by e-mail and through social media. Statistical analyses were performed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square test; a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 200 pediatric dentists participated in this study and most of them (82%) only performed emergency dental treatments, whereas 18.5% performed both emergency and routine dental practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vast majority (72.5%) of pediatric dentists prescribed antibiotics and analgesics to their patients who were not cooperative with non-pharmacological behavior management techniques. The findings of the current study showed that the Turkish pediatric dentists had a good level of knowledge about COVID-19, satisfactorily conducted most of the infection control measures before and after the dental treatments, and attached importance to the use of PPEs; however, infection control measures during the dental treatments could be implemented better. Conclusions: Along with all precautions, the vaccination of healthcare workers and requesting a recent test result from patients showing a lack of COVID-19 disease before dental appointments could be used as effective infection control measures. Additionally, pediatric dentists should continue to follow local and universal guidelines, and education programmes should be frequently implemented in order to keep their COVID-19 management strategies up to date."
34833366,Can Deep Learning-Based Volumetric Analysis Predict Oxygen Demand Increase in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia?
34833366,"Background and Objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether predictive indicators for the deterioration of respiratory status can be derived from the deep learning data analysis of initial chest computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and Methods: Out of 117 CT scans of 75 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital between April and June 2020, we retrospectively analyzed 79 CT scans that had a definite time of onset and were performed prior to any medication intervention. Patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of increased oxygen demand after CT scan. Quantitative volume data of lung opacity were measured automatically using a deep learning-based image analysis system. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the opacity volume data were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the system in predicting the deterioration of respiratory status. Results: All 79 CT scans were included (median age, 62 years (interquartile range, 46-77 years); 56 (70.9%) were male. The volume of opacity was significantly higher for the increased oxygen demand group than for the nonincreased oxygen demand group (585.3 vs. 132.8 mL, p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 76.5%, 68.2%, and 0.737, respectively, in the prediction of increased oxygen demand. Conclusion: Deep learning-based quantitative analysis of the affected lung volume in the initial CT scans of patients with COVID-19 can predict the deterioration of respiratory status to improve treatment and resource management."

34833382,Vaccine-Associated Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis: Venous Endotheliopathy Leading to Venous Combined Micro-Macrothrombosis.
34833382,"Serious vaccine-associated side effects are very rare. Major complications of vaccines are thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in which pathogenetic mechanism is consistent with endotheliopathy characterized by ""attenuated"" sepsis-like syndrome, leading to the activation of inflammatory and microthrombotic pathway. In the COVID-19 pandemic, acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by microthrombosis has been the major clinical phenotype from the viral sepsis in association with endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD), sometimes presenting with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome. Often, venous thromboembolism has coexisted due to additional vascular injury. In contrast, clinical phenotypes of vaccine complication have included ""silent"" immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP-like syndrome), multiorgan inflammatory syndrome, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in particular. These findings are consistent with venous (v) EA-VMTD. In vEA-VMTD promoted by activated complement system following vaccination, ""consumptive"" thrombocytopenia develops as ITP-like syndrome due to activated unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) path of hemostasis via microthrombogenesis. Thus, the pathologic phenotype of ITP-like syndrome is venous microthrombosis. Myocarditis/pericarditis and other rare cases of inflammatory organ syndrome are promoted by inflammatory cytokines released from activated inflammatory pathway, leading to various organ endotheliitis. Vaccine-associated CVST is a form of venous combined ""micro-macrothrombosis"" composed of binary components of ""microthrombi strings"" from vEA-VMTD and ""fibrin meshes"" from vaccine-unrelated incidental vascular injury perhaps such as unreported head trauma. This mechanism is identified based on ""two-path unifying theory"" of in vivo hemostasis. Venous combined micro-macrothrombosis due to vaccine is much more serious thrombosis than isolated distal DVT made of macrothrombus. This paradigm changing novel concept of combined micro-macrothrombosis implies the need of combined therapy of a complement inhibitor and anticoagulant for CVST and other complex forms of DVT."
34833403,Does the COVID-19 Pandemic Affect Morbidity and Mortality Rates of Emergency General Surgery? A Retrospective Study from a Single-Center Tertiary Greek Hospital.
34833403,"Background and Objectives: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on all aspects of health care. Few up-to-date studies have actually assessed the impact of COVID-19 on emergency surgeries. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic relating to the emergency surgery performed, as well as morbidity and mortality rates during the first year of the pandemic (March 2020-February 2021) and during the control period. In this period, the first propaedeutic surgery department and the third surgery department of the University General Hospital of Thessaloniki ""AHEPA"" in Greece provided continuous emergency general surgery services. Material and Methods: The study is in a retrospective cohort and included patients who were admitted to the Emergency Department and underwent emergency general surgery during the control period (n = 456), March 2019-February 2020 and during the first year of the pandemic (n = 223), March 2020-February 2021. Gender, age, type of surgical operation (morbidity), ICU need, the patient's outcome, and days of hospitalization were compared. Results: A total of 679 emergency surgeries were included. Statistically significant differences emerged between the two time periods in the total number of emergency surgeries performed (p < 0.001). The most common type of surgery in the control period was associated with soft tissue infection while, during the pandemic period, the most common type of surgery was associated with the hepatobiliary system. In addition, the mortality rates nearly doubled during the pandemic period (2.2% vs. 4%). Finally, the mean age of our sample was 50.6 ± 17.5 and the majority of the participants in both time periods were males. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic changed significantly the total number of emergency general surgeries performed. Mortality rates doubled and morbidity rates were affected between the control and pandemic periods. Finally, age, gender, length of hospitalization, intensive care unit hospitalization, and laparoscopy use in patients undergoing emergency surgery during the pandemic were stable."
34833404,The Rare Case of a COVID-19 Pregnant Patient with Quadruplets and Postpartum Severe Pneumonia. Case Report and Review of the Literature.
34833404,"Background and Objectives: The multiple pregnancies associated with COVID-19 is a new and difficult condition to manage. The prognosis for rapid deterioration after the cesarean delivery is difficult to assess and needs close interdisciplinary follow-up due to pregnancy and postpartum-related changes. Materials and Methods: We report the case of a 37-year-old primigesta primipara patient who was admitted to ""Elena Doamna"" Clinical Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology at 33 weeks and 3 days of gestation with high-grade multiple pregnancies (triplets) for threatened premature birth associated with COVID-19. The patient had a history of surgically corrected atrial septal defect during childhood and currently is known to have paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Tocolysis was ineffective and the decision to perform a cesarean operation was made. The diagnosis was established: primigesta, primipara, at 34 weeks of gestation, high-grade multiple pregnancy with triplets, intact membranes, threatened premature birth, surgically corrected atrial septal defect, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, infection with COVID-19. The patient underwent a cesarean intervention and treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. The intervention took place at 33 weeks and 4 days of gestation resulting in four newborns with weights between 1400 g and 1820 g and Apgar scores between 6-8. All newborns were transferred to a third-degree Neonatology ICU service due to their prematurity. The fourth newborn was not identified in any of the ultrasounds performed during pregnancy. During the postpartum period, the patient had a fulminant evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia, with rapid deterioration, needing respiratory support and antiviral treatment. Discussions: Managing high-risk obstetrical pregnancies associated with COVID-19 requires a multidisciplinary team consisting of obstetricians, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, and infectious disease doctors. Conclusion: Our case is the first to our knowledge in Romania to present an association of high-grade multiple pregancy with COVID19 moderate form, rapidly evolving postpartum, needing rapid intensive care admission, and specific treatment with Remdesivir, with good post-treatment evolution."
34833407,COVID-19 and Its Repercussions on Oral Health: A Review.
34833407,"In 2019, a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causing agent of COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. The manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly age-dependent and potentially more severe in cases with involved co-morbidities. The gravity of the symptoms depends on the clinical stage of the infection. The most common symptoms include runny nose and nasal congestion, anosmia, dysgeusia or hypogeusia, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, respiratory distress, fatigue, ocular symptoms, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. These systemic conditions are often accompanied by skin and mucosal lesions. Oral lesions reported in patients with COVID-19 include: herpex simplex, candidiasis, geographic tongue, aphthous-like ulcers, hemorrhagic ulcerations, necrotic ulcerations, white hairy tongue, reddish macules, erythematous surfaces, petechiae, and pustular enanthema. It is still unclear if these manifestations are a direct result of the viral infection, a consequence of systemic deterioration, or adverse reactions to treatments. Poor oral hygiene in hospitalized or quarantined COVID-19 patients should also be considered as an aggravating condition. This narrative review is focused on presenting the most relevant data from the literature regarding oral manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the challenges faced by the dental system during this pandemic. A routine intraoral examination is recommended in COVID-19 patients, either suspected or confirmed, as, in certain cases, oral manifestations represent a sign of severe infection or even of a life-threatening condition. It is our belief that extensive knowledge of all possible manifestations, including oral lesions, in cases of COVID-19 is of great importance in the present uncertain context, including new, currently emerging viral variants with unknown future impact."
34833417,Automated Medical Care: Bradycardia Detection and Cardiac Monitoring of Preterm Infants.
34833417,"Background and Objectives: Prematurity of birth occurs before the 37th week of gestation and affects up to 10% of births worldwide. It is correlated with critical outcomes; therefore, constant monitoring in neonatal intensive care units or home environments is required. The aim of this work was to develop solutions for remote neonatal intensive supervision systems, which should assist medical diagnosis of premature infants and raise alarm at cardiac abnormalities, such as bradycardia. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has put a worldwide stress upon the medical staff and the management of healthcare units. Materials and Methods: A traditional medical diagnosing scheme was set up, implemented with the aid of powerful mathematical operators. The algorithm was tailored to the infants' personal ECG characteristics and was tested on real ECG data from the publicly available PhysioNet database ""Preterm Infant Cardio-Respiratory Signals Database"". Different processing problems were solved: noise filtering, baseline drift removal, event detection and compression of medical data using the à trous wavelet transform. Results: In all 10 available clinical cases, the bradycardia events annotated by the physicians were correctly detected using the RR intervals. Compressing the ECG signals for remote transmission, we obtained compression ratios (CR) varying from 1.72 to 7.42, with the median CR value around 3. Conclusions: We noticed that a significant amount of noise can be added to a signal while monitoring using standard clinical sensors. We tried to offer solutions for these technical problems. Recent studies have shown that persons infected with the COVID-19 disease are frequently reported to develop cardiovascular symptoms and cardiac arrhythmias. An automatic surveillance system (both for neonates and adults) has a practical medical application. The proposed algorithm is personalized, no fixed reference value being applied, and the algorithm follows the neonate's cardiac rhythm changes. The performance depends on the characteristics of the input ECG. The signal-to-noise ratio of the processed ECG was improved, with a value of up to 10 dB."
34833452,Did the COVID-19 Pandemic Prolong the Time Till Diagnosis and Worsen Outcomes for Children with Acute Appendicitis?
34833452,"Background and Objectives: Our aim was to see if the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase of time until diagnosis, operation, and time spent in Emergency room (ER), and if it resulted in more cases of complicated appendicitis and complication rates in children. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the Pediatric Surgery Department with acute appendicitis during a 4-month period of the first COVID-19 pandemic and compared it to the previous year data-the same 4-month period in 2019. Results: During the pandemic, the time spent in the ER until arriving at the department increased significantly 2.85 vs. 0.98 h p < 0.001, and the time spent in the department until the operation 5.31 vs. 2.66 h, p = 0.03. However, the time from the beginning of symptoms till ER, operation time and the length of stay at the hospital, as well as the overall time until operation did not differ and did not result in an increase of complicated appendicitis cases or postoperative complications. Conclusions: The COVID-19-implemented quarantine led to an increase of the time from the emergency room to the operating room by 4 h. This delay did not result in a higher rate of complicated appendicitis and complication rates, allowing for surgery to be postponed to daytime hours if needed."
34833462,Delirium and Cognitive Impairment as Predisposing Factors of COVID-19 Infection in Neuropsychiatric Patients: A Narrative Review.
34833462,"SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasive and neurotropic abilities may underlie delirium onset and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Only a limited number of studies have addressed the potential effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health so far. Most studies mainly reported the acute onset of mixed neuropsychiatric conditions in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by agitated behavior, altered level of consciousness, and disorganized thinking, regardless of psychological or socioeconomic triggering factors. The present narrative review aims to analyze and discuss the mechanisms underlying the neuroinvasive/neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent mental complications. Delirium appeared as a clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 brain infection in some patients, without systemic or multiple organ failure symptoms. A small number of studies demonstrated that neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19, initially presenting as a confused state, may subsequently evolve in a way that is consistent with the patients' neuropsychiatric history. A literature analysis on this topic prevalently showed case reports and case series of patients presenting delirium or delirium-like symptoms as the main outburst of COVID-19, plus a cognitive impairment, from mild to severe, which pre-existed or was demonstrated during the acute phase or after infection. Dementia appeared as one of the most frequent predisposing factors to SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated with delirium. Instead, contrasting data emerged on the potential link between COVID-19 and delirium in patients with cognitive impairment and without a neuropsychiatric history. Therefore, clinicians should contemplate the possibility that COVID-19 appears as delirium followed by a psychiatric exacerbation, even without other systemic symptoms. In addition, cognitive impairment might act as a predisposing factor for COVID-19 in patients with delirium."
34833491,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Department Workload and Emergency Care Workers' Psychosocial Stress in the Outbreak Area.
34833491,"Background and Objectives: Due to the unexpected spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there was a serious crisis of emergency medical system collapse. Healthcare workers working in the emergency department were faced with psychosocial stress and workload changes. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in the emergency department in Daegu and Gyeongbuk, Korea, from November 16 to 25, 2020. In the survey, we assessed the general characteristics of the respondents; changes in the working conditions before and after the COVID-19 pandemic; and resulting post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety statuses using 49 questions. Results: A total of 529 responses were collected, and 520 responses were included for the final analyses. Changes in working conditions and other factors due to COVID-19 varied by emergency department level, region and disease group. Working hours, intensity, role changes, depression and anxiety scores were higher in the higher level emergency department. Isolation ward insufficiency and the risk of infection felt by healthcare workers tended to increase in the lower level emergency department. Treatment and transfer delay were higher in the fever and respiratory disease groups (M = 3.58, SD = 1.18; M = 4.08, SD = 0.95), respectively. In all the disease groups, both treatment and transfer were delayed more in Gyeongbuk than in Daegu. Conclusions: Different goals should be pursued by the levels and region of the emergency department to overcome the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and promote optimal care."
34833496,Meta-Analysis of Prevalence of Depression in Dental Students during COVID-19 Pandemic.
34833496,"Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on the mental health of the population in general, and in college students in particular. Dental students have seen their teaching altered and their clinical practice reduced. This study was aimed at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting levels of depression among dental students during the COVID-19 and estimating the pooled prevalence of depression. Materials and Methods: Medline via PubMed and other databases were searched for studies on the prevalence of depression in dental undergraduates, published from 1 December 2019 to 1 September 2021. The pooled proportions of depression were calculated with random effects models. Results: We identified 13 studies from 9 countries. The pooled prevalence of depression in dental students was 37% (95% CI: 26-49%) with no variation due to gender, response rate or methodological quality. We only found a significantly higher prevalence of depression in studies from Asia compared to Europe and America. Conclusions: Our results suggest that dental students are suffering from higher levels of depression compared with the general population or other college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with differences across regions. Measures to improve mental health and wellbeing of dental students during the pandemic are needed."
34833547,Smart Face Mask with an Integrated Heat Flux Sensor for Fast and Remote People's Healthcare Monitoring.
34833547,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a large amount of challenges to address. To combat the spread of the virus, several safety measures, such as wearing face masks, have been taken. Temperature controls at the entrance of public places to prevent the entry of virus carriers have been shown to be inefficient and inaccurate. This paper presents a smart mask that allows to monitor body temperature and breathing rate. Body temperature is measured by a non-invasive dual-heat-flux system, consisting of four sensors separated from each other with an insulating material. Breathing rate is obtained from the temperature changes within the mask, measured with a thermistor located near the nose. The system communicates by means of long-range (LoRa) backscattering, leading to a reduction in average power consumption. It is designed to establish the relative location of the smart mask from the signal received at two LoRa receivers installed inside and outside an access door. Low-cost LoRa transceivers with WiFi capabilities are used in the prototype to collect information and upload it to a server. Accuracy in body temperature measurements is consistent with measurements made with a thermistor located in the armpit. The system allows checking the correct placement of the mask based on the recorded temperatures and the breathing rate measurements. Besides, episodes of cough can be detected by sudden changes in thermistor temperature."
34833587,The Comparative Estimation of Primary Students' Programming Outcomes Based on Traditional and Distance Out-of-School Extracurricular Informatics Education in Electronics Courses during the Challenging COVID-19 Period.
34833587,"The authors decided to investigate the impact of the lockdown period and the resulting limitations in informatics education, especially programming, in out-of-school electronics courses using traditional and distance learning modes in primary school COVID-19 pandemic settings. Two extracurricular courses were held successively; the first electronics course was performed in a traditional out-of-school learning mode using Arduino kits, while the other was held using the TinkerCad circuits virtual environment in distance learning mode. A structured questionnaire was administered to students to map their knowledge of programming. The questionnaire consists of three emotional dimensions: enjoyment, satisfaction and motivation. The fourth dimension was dedicated to the students' programming outcomes. Three emotional dimensions were addressed to primary school students, while the fourth dimension was addressed to the tutors' observations toward the students' programming outcomes. The obtained results revealed that learning modes have no significant impact on students perceiving the programming issues. However, three emotional dimensions revealed a significant difference in the students' enjoyment, satisfaction and motivation in favor of the traditional learning mode. Our findings are of particular interest in light of possible crisis-prompted distance education in the future but can also serve to inform government institutions and policymakers seeking to develop effective concepts for successful distance learning."
34833616,Body Temperature Monitoring for Regular COVID-19 Prevention Based on Human Daily Activity Recognition.
34833616,"Existing wearable systems that use G-sensors to identify daily activities have been widely applied for medical, sports and military applications, while body temperature as an obvious physical characteristic that has rarely been considered in the system design and relative applications of HAR. In the context of the normalization of COVID-19, the prevention and control of the epidemic has become a top priority. Temperature monitoring plays an important role in the preliminary screening of the population for fever. Therefore, this paper proposes a wearable device embedded with inertial and temperature sensors that is used to apply human behavior recognition (HAR) to body surface temperature detection for body temperature monitoring and adjustment by evaluating recognition algorithms. The sensing system consists of an STM 32-based microcontroller, a 6-axis (accelerometer and gyroscope) sensor, and a temperature sensor to capture the original data from 10 individual participants under 4 different daily activity scenarios. Then, the collected raw data are pre-processed by signal standardization, data stacking and resampling. For HAR, several machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are implemented to classify the activities. To compare the performance of different classifiers on the seven-dimensional dataset with temperature sensing signals, evaluation metrics and the algorithm running time are considered, and random forest (RF) is found to be the best-performing classifier with 88.78% recognition accuracy, which is higher than the case of the absence of temperature data (<78%). In addition, the experimental results show that participants' body surface temperature in dynamic activities was lower compared to sitting, which can be associated with the possible missing fever population due to temperature deviations in COVID-19 prevention. According to different individual activities, epidemic prevention workers are supposed to infer the corresponding standard normal body temperature of a patient by referring to the specific values of the mean expectation and variance in the normal distribution curve provided in this paper."
34833630,Future Trends in Semiconducting Gas-Selective Sensing Probes for Skin Diagnostics.
34833630,"This paper presents sensor nanotechnologies that can be used for the skin-based gas ""smelling"" of disease. Skin testing may provide rapid and reliable results, using specific ""fingerprints"" or unique patterns for a variety of diseases and conditions. These can include metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and cholesterol-induced heart disease; neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; quality of life conditions, such as obesity and sleep apnea; pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal tract diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome and colitis; cancers, such as breast, lung, pancreatic, and colon cancers; infectious diseases, such as the flu and COVID-19; as well as diseases commonly found in ICU patients, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and infections of the blood stream. Focusing on the most common gaseous biomarkers in breath and skin, which is nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and certain abundant volatile organic compounds (acetone, isoprene, ammonia, alcohols, sulfides), it is argued here that effective discrimination between the diseases mentioned above is possible, by capturing the relative sensor output signals from the detection of each of these biomarkers and identifying the distinct breath print for each disease."
34833656,Sentimental Analysis of COVID-19 Related Messages in Social Networks by Involving an N-Gram Stacked Autoencoder Integrated in an Ensemble Learning Scheme.
34833656,"The current population worldwide extensively uses social media to share thoughts, societal issues, and personal concerns. Social media can be viewed as an intelligent platform that can be augmented with a capability to analyze and predict various issues such as business needs, environmental needs, election trends (polls), governmental needs, etc. This has motivated us to initiate a comprehensive search of the COVID-19 pandemic-related views and opinions amongst the population on Twitter. The basic training data have been collected from Twitter posts. On this basis, we have developed research involving ensemble deep learning techniques to reach a better prediction of the future evolutions of views in Twitter when compared to previous works that do the same. First, feature extraction is performed through an N-gram stacked autoencoder supervised learning algorithm. The extracted features are then involved in a classification and prediction involving an ensemble fusion scheme of selected machine learning techniques such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). all individual results are combined/fused for a better prediction by using both mean and mode techniques. Our proposed scheme of an N-gram stacked encoder integrated in an ensemble machine learning scheme outperforms all the other existing competing techniques such unigram autoencoder, bigram autoencoder, etc. Our experimental results have been obtained from a comprehensive evaluation involving a dataset extracted from open-source data available from Twitter that were filtered by using the keywords ""covid"", ""covid19"", ""coronavirus"", ""covid-19"", ""sarscov2"", and ""covid_19""."
34833681,CyberEye: New Eye-Tracking Interfaces for Assessment and Modulation of Cognitive Functions beyond the Brain.
34833681,"The emergence of innovative neurotechnologies in global brain projects has accelerated research and clinical applications of BCIs beyond sensory and motor functions. Both invasive and noninvasive sensors are developed to interface with cognitive functions engaged in thinking, communication, or remembering. The detection of eye movements by a camera offers a particularly attractive external sensor for computer interfaces to monitor, assess, and control these higher brain functions without acquiring signals from the brain. Features of gaze position and pupil dilation can be effectively used to track our attention in healthy mental processes, to enable interaction in disorders of consciousness, or to even predict memory performance in various brain diseases. In this perspective article, we propose the term 'CyberEye' to encompass emerging cognitive applications of eye-tracking interfaces for neuroscience research, clinical practice, and the biomedical industry. As CyberEye technologies continue to develop, we expect BCIs to become less dependent on brain activities, to be less invasive, and to thus be more applicable."
34833713,Digital Integration and Automated Assessment of Eye-Tracking and Emotional Response Data Using the BioSensory App to Maximize Packaging Label Analysis.
34833713,"New and emerging non-invasive digital tools, such as eye-tracking, facial expression and physiological biometrics, have been implemented to extract more objective sensory responses by panelists from packaging and, specifically, labels. However, integrating these technologies from different company providers and software for data acquisition and analysis makes their practical application difficult for research and the industry. This study proposed a prototype integration between eye tracking and emotional biometrics using the BioSensory computer application for three sample labels: Stevia, Potato chips, and Spaghetti. Multivariate data analyses are presented, showing the integrative analysis approach of the proposed prototype system. Further studies can be conducted with this system and integrating other biometrics available, such as physiological response with heart rate, blood, pressure, and temperature changes analyzed while focusing on different label components or packaging features. By maximizing data extraction from various components of packaging and labels, smart predictive systems can also be implemented, such as machine learning to assess liking and other parameters of interest from the whole package and specific components."
34833742,Mobile Eye-Tracking Data Analysis Using Object Detection via YOLO v4.
34833742,"Remote eye tracking has become an important tool for the online analysis of learning processes. Mobile eye trackers can even extend the range of opportunities (in comparison to stationary eye trackers) to real settings, such as classrooms or experimental lab courses. However, the complex and sometimes manual analysis of mobile eye-tracking data often hinders the realization of extensive studies, as this is a very time-consuming process and usually not feasible for real-world situations in which participants move or manipulate objects. In this work, we explore the opportunities to use object recognition models to assign mobile eye-tracking data for real objects during an authentic students' lab course. In a comparison of three different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a Faster Region-Based-CNN, you only look once (YOLO) v3, and YOLO v4, we found that YOLO v4, together with an optical flow estimation, provides the fastest results with the highest accuracy for object detection in this setting. The automatic assignment of the gaze data to real objects simplifies the time-consuming analysis of mobile eye-tracking data and offers an opportunity for real-time system responses to the user's gaze. Additionally, we identify and discuss several problems in using object detection for mobile eye-tracking data that need to be considered."

34837698,"A prototype of a system for the detection of infectious human pneumonia pathogens based on multiplex solid-phase reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was developed. Primers were designed to identify the DNA of six bacterial pneumonia pathogen strains, and the RNA of two viral pathogens of pneumonia: influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. The signal accumulation of elongated immobilized primers occurs due to the incorporation of fluorescently labeled nucleotides in the chain. The signal is detected after all the components of the mixture are removed, which significantly reduces the background signal and increases the sensitivity of the analysis. The use of a specialized detector makes it possible to read the signals of elongated primers directly through the transparent cover film of the reaction chamber. This solution is designed to prevent cross-contamination and is suitable for simultaneous testing of a large number of test samples. The proposed platform is able to detect the presence of several pathogens of pneumonia in a sample and has an open architecture that allows expansion of the range of pathogenic bacteria and viruses that can be detected."
34837703,[Immunogenic Properties of the DNA Construct Encoding the Receptor-Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein].
34837703,"The development of preventive vaccines became the first order task in the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. This paper reports the construction of the pVAX-RBD plasmid containing the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the S protein and a unique signal sequence 176 which promotes target protein secretion into the extracellular space thereby increasing the efficiency of humoral immune response activation. A polyglucine-spermidine conjugate (PGS) was used to deliver pVAX-RBD into the cells. The comparative immunogenicity study of the naked pVAX-RBD and pVAX-RBD enclosed in the PGS envelope showed that the latter was more efficient in inducing an immune response in the immunized mice. In particular, RBD-specific antibody titers were shown in ELISA to be no higher than 1 : 1000 in the animals from the pVAX-RBD group and 1 : 42000, in the pVAX-RBD-PGS group. The pVAX-RBD-PGS construct effectively induced cellular immune response. Using ELISpot, it has been demonstrated that splenocytes obtained from the immunized animals effectively produced INF-y in response to stimulation with the S protein-derived peptide pool. The results suggest that the polyglucine-spermidine conjugate-enveloped pVAX-RBD construct may be considered as a promising DNA vaccine against COVID-19."

34839682,Going above and beyond: using nursing theories to explore volunteerism during the COVID-19 pandemic.
34839682,"Historically, nurses have volunteered to serve in wars and natural catastrophes. However, instead of a distant disaster, many nurses in the UK volunteered, working above and beyond, to assist their colleagues, local communities and health systems in the NHS during the peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the motivations and benefits to the community or self of volunteerism have been discussed in the literature, there is a paucity of literature and theoretical understanding from the field of nursing. Using a reflective and personal account of volunteering, this article aims to provide a better understanding of the concept of volunteerism in nursing. By exploring associated nursing theories from Jean Watson and Kristen Swanson, this article aims to illuminate and expand the knowledge base about nursing volunteerism. These nursing theories can frame the act of volunteerism and nursing and illustrate the interrelations of nursing theory and the practice of nursing volunteerism."

COVID-19 vaccine mandates must be understood and assessed in terms of who is requiring vaccination and who is required to be vaccinated. This essay considers the legal and ethical implications of states mandating vaccination for children and adults, as well as of employers mandating vaccines for employees. We conclude that COVID-19 vaccine mandates are legally and ethically permissible."
34840553,Psychological Distress and Anxiety Levels Among Health Care Workers at the Height of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Arab Emirates.
34840553,"Objectives: Providing medical care during a global pandemic exposes healthcare workers (HCW) to a high level of risk, causing anxiety and stress. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and psychological distress among HCWs during COVID-19. Methods: We invited HCWs from 3 hospitals across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to participate in an anonymous online survey between April 19-May 3, 2020. The GAD-7 and K10 measures were used to assess anxiety and psychological distress. Logistic regression models assessed associations between knowledge, attitude, worry, and levels of anxiety and psychological distress. Results: A total of 481 HCWs participated in this study. The majority of HCWs were female (73.6%) and aged 25-34 years (52.6%). More than half were nurses (55.7%) and had good knowledge of COVID-19 (86.3%). Over a third (37%) of HCWs reported moderate/severe psychological distress in the K10 measure and moderate/severe anxiety (32.3%) in the GAD-7, with frontline workers significantly reporting higher levels of anxiety (36%). Knowledge of COVID-19 did not predict anxiety and psychological distress, however, HCWs who believed COVID-19 was difficult to treat and those who perceived they were at high risk of infection had worse mental health outcomes. Worry about spreading COVID-19 to family, being isolated, contracting COVID-19 and feeling stigmatized had 1.8- to 2.5-fold increased odds of symptoms of mental health problems. Additionally, HCWs who felt the need for psychological support through their workplace showed increased odds of psychological distress. Conclusion: HCWs in the UAE reported a high prevalence of psychological distress and anxiety while responding to the challenges of COVID-19. The findings from this study emphasize the public, emotional and mental health burden of COVID-19 and highlight the importance for health systems to implement, monitor, and update preventive policies to protect HCWs from contracting the virus while also providing psychological support in the workplace."

34841750,[Educational Environment: The Most Powerful Factor for the Onset and Development of Myopia among Students].
34841750,"Based on the literature on myopia epidemiology, experiments of basic science, and clinical research, we have identified a number of major characteristics of the myopia problem. It was concluded that the student population of grades 1-12 showed high incidence of myopia and the problem was becoming increasingly more serious. Etiological investigations revealed the aggressive role played by environmental factors. Mature clinical correction methods were available, but there were still a multitude of uncertainties hampering the effort to slow the progression of myopia. Student myopia has become an issue of top concern in China's effort to prevent and control myopia. In order to approach the issue by dealing with problems in the educational environment and to explore for specific measures to prevent and control the onset and development of student myopia, it is important that we gain better understanding of the multiple effects on the onset and development of student myopia caused by the growing demand for education induced by high social development and the rapid changes in the educational environment caused by technological advancement. Approaching the problem from the perspective of the features of the eye and vision in the developmental stages of students of grades 1-12, and the study workload at each stage, this paper retrospectively reviewed the historical literature from the last 90 years and the data from cohort studies done before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Identifying the education environment as the primary factor causing the onset and progression of student myopia, the paper fully recognizes the scientific rationality of and the specific role served by education-medicine synergy in student myopia prevention and control."

The outbreak of COVID-19 leaves us with much to reflect on and calls on our attention to respiratory infectious diseases, especially new outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases that are zoonotic. The importance of identifying viral pathogens should be highlighted because it is related to the prevention and treatment strategy of childhood pneumonia. Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, the rapid mutation of the virus, and the lack of specific drugs, vaccines are currently the most effective means of prevention, and a global immune barrier must be established as soon as possible."

The effect of different protein fragments on the performance of the method was evaluated. The N protein sequence was analyzed by bioinformatics technology, expressed in prokaryotic cell and purified by metal ion affinity chromatography column. Different N protein fragments were prepared for comparison. EDC reaction was used to label fluorescence microsphere on the synthesized antigen to construct sandwich fluorescence chromatography antibody detection assay, and the performance was systemically evaluated. Among the 4 prepared N protein fragments, the full-length N protein (N419) was selected as the optimized coating antigen, N412 with 0.5 mol/L NaCl was used as the optimal combination; deleting 91-120 amino acids from the N-terminal of N412 reduced non-specific signal by 87.5%. the linear range of detection was 0.312-80 U/L, the limit of detection was 0.165 U/L, and the accuracy was more than 95%. A fluorescence immunochromatographic detection method for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 total antibody was established by pairing N protein fragments. The detection result achieved 98% concordance with the commercially available Guangzhou Wanfu test strip, which is expected to be used as a supplementary approach for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The assay could also provide experimental reference for improving the performance of COVID-19 antibody detection reagents."

In the early stages, there were few data on the resultant changes to the provision of dental services or their impact on the wellbeing of dental professionals. Solutions Suggested: Two questionnaires were designed to explore different domains in OHCP working on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as in other areas/sectors. The findings were intended to inform guidance documents and to better support the profession. Findings: Anxiety-provoking factors, challenges, and areas of concern of OHCP were identified and practical recommendations to support transitioning to the 'new normal' were presented. OHCP expressed anxiety about contracting COVID-19 from their workplace and passing infection to other family members, friends, or patients. As a result, OHCP expressed the need for better protective clothing, workplace ventilation, and air filtration systems. Future implications: Provision of adequate PPE for OHCP was a priority. New guidelines for dental practice were informed by the experiences of the particpating OHCP. University modules to enhance the resilience of OHCP were among the recommendations to support practitioners."
